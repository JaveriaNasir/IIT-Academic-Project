(b) Answers to the following questions:
i. How do you run your program (i.e. what is the command line)?
This project is not a command line program.It is a GUI based desktop application.This project can be run by running the HotelRegistration.java form.

ii. Describe your object-oriented design for the program:
A. How are you implementing the hotel registry?
The hotel registry is implemented using java swing application.It has 3 forms HotelRegistration.java,Check-In.java,Check-Out.java and about.java classes. Apart from these GUI classes it has CustomerDetails.java class which collects the customer information and stores each and evey detail of the CheckIn.java form.
I have used Obeject oriented programming ,polymorphism, encapsulation ,inheritence concepts and implmented MVC pattern as data is kept seperatley in one class , View is seperated and controller is used to tranfer data from view to model.
 
B.How are you implementing the different types of rooms?
Using hash map I am adding roomtypes and room numbers assciated with it.

C. How are you dynamically updating the forms and main frame based on the clerk’s
actions?
Dynamically updating the main frame from the forms by retrieving the data stored in customerdetails class and passing the values to main frame.

iii. What specific problems or challenges did you have implementing your solution? For example,
was there a particular requirement that you had difficulty implementing? Or perhaps
there was a particularly nasty bug in your implementation you had problems tracking down.
I faced a big challenge in populating the checkout form rooms as i was unable to pass the values for a while.

iv. Were there any requirements that were not implemented or not implemented properly in
your solution? If so, please elaborate.
I couldnt implement the validation of number of adults and children and to display room based on this.Apart from this all the requirments are implememnted.

v. Were there any requirements that were vague or open to interpretation that you had to make
a decision on how to implement? How did you elect to interpret them?

As mentioned above i had to think a lot of on how to implement the rooms for check-out form.but was able to achive it.

vi. How would you rate the complexity of this MP on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is very easy
and 10 is very difficult. Why did you give this rating?
As implementing GUI application in Swing was very new to me .Initially i faced lot of problems in getting started as i had to to few handson examples.but it was good as and when i kept proceeding forward.I would like to rate this as 7/10.

The project is completely tested and verifed abd is working as expected.
