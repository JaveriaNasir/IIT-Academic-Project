(b) Answers to the following questions:
i. How do you run your program (i.e. what is the command line)?
   This project is not a command line program.It is a GUI based desktop application.This project can    be run by running the PointOfSale.java form.

ii. Describe your object-oriented design for the program:
A. How are you implementing the costs?
   For reading the costs and items available in store, the costs.txt file is placed inside the project folder.
B. How are you implementing the sales?
   For reading the sales available in store, the Discounts.txt file is placed inside the project    folder.
C. How are you implementing a customer’s order?
   To place a customer's order a simple GUI i been made which consists of a SKU text field , an add    button , a totla items field and total costs field. The user enters the SKU and when he clicks on    add item that item gets added to the register tape i.e the text area.Once constomers order is    completed the user clicks on the pay button. which generates reciept a bill to the customer and    the record is added to RegisterTape file.This GUI automatically calculats the total no of items    purchased and tolal cost of them and populates it to the total items field and total costs field.
   On click of Pay button all the fiedls get reset.
iii. What specific problems or challenges did you have implementing your solution? For example,
was there a particular requirement that you had difficulty implementing? Or perhaps
there was a particularly nasty bug in your implementation you had problems tracking down.
   Sales requirement was little tricky to solve. But it was a good learning with this project as got to learn Input/Output operations.

iv. Were there any requirements that were not implemented or not implemented properly in
your solution? If so, please elaborate.
    Have implemented all the solutions as per the requirment.
v. Were there any requirements that were vague or open to interpretation that you had to make
a decision on how to implement? How did you elect to interpret them?
Faced problem in implementing the Sales requirement.FOr that i created HashMap where i have all the data of text files to read and i can retreive the data and populate the text fields in GUI.
vi. How would you rate the complexity of this MP on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is very easy
and 10 is very difficult. Why did you give this rating?It was a good project and learning for Input/output file reader and Buffer writed concepts.I would like to rate this project as 8/10.
